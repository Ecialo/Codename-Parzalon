#Dialog 1
Parzalon:"Die, monster. You don't belong in this world!"
Enemy:"It was not by my hand that I am once again given flesh."
Enemy:"I was called here by humans who wished to pay me tribute."
Parzalon:"Tribute? You steal men's souls, and make them your slaves!"
Enemy:"Perhaps the same could be said of all religions."
Parzalon:"Your words are as empty as your soul."
Parzalon:"Mankind ill needs a savior such as you!"
Enemy:"What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets!"
Enemy:"But enough talk; have at you!"
